                <section class="article-intro">
                    <p>Today, I released a new iOS app called "Fuchidori!"</p>
                    
                    <p>This app allows you to easily cut out people and objects from photos with just one finger, add borders of your desired color and thickness, and instantly create stylish sticker-like images. It's a simple and fun app.</p>

                    <p>However, behind the birth of this app lies another SNS concept I had been working on and a "fateful comment" from someone. Today, I'd like to share the behind-the-scenes story of this development.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="article-section">
                    <h2>It All Started with the "mono" SNS Concept</h2>
                    
                    <p>Originally, I was conceptualizing an SNS called "mono" - a platform for recording and sharing the value of your beloved "things."</p>

                    <p>If marketplace apps are places to "sell things," then "mono" would be a place to "cherish things." That was the world I was aiming to create. As an important feature of this SNS, I was developing a <strong>"background removal & border feature"</strong> to make photos of posted items more attractive.</p>

                    <p>Because people love their items, I wanted them to post them in the best possible way. That was the passion I put into creating this feature.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="article-section">
                    <h2>The Tweet That Changed Everything</h2>
                    
                    <p>One day, I casually shared a demo video of this "border feature" on Twitter (X).</p>

                    <p>Then, hirothings (@hirothings) left this comment on that tweet:</p>

                    <blockquote class="twitter-quote">
                        <p>"Amazing, that feature alone could be a hit"</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>This comment was truly a bolt from the blue.</p>

                    <p>I had been so focused on creating the large SNS called "mono" that I couldn't see the brilliance of "that one feature" that might be the most valuable part.</p>

                    <p>What users really want might not be complex apps packed with many features, but simple, powerful tools that solve one problem exceptionally well.</p>

                    <p>Encouraged by hirothings' words, I made a decision:<br>
                    <strong>"Alright, I'll create the world's most user-friendly app focused solely on this feature!"</strong></p>
                </section>

                <section class="article-section">
                    <h2>And Thus "Fuchidori!" Was Born</h2>
                    
                    <p>"Fuchidori!" was born from this background. What I focused on was making it simple, fun, and secure above all.</p>

                    <ul class="feature-highlights">
                        <li><strong>Surprisingly simple operation</strong> that anyone can use intuitively.</li>
                        <li><strong>Free choice of colors and thickness</strong> to create your original works.</li>
                        <li>And the biggest commitment: <strong>complete offline operation</strong> that absolutely protects your privacy. Your precious photos will never be sent to any server.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Whether you use it to make marketplace product photos stand out, express your personality in SNS profile pictures, or enjoy "fan activities" with photos of your favorite idols - the usage is up to you.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="article-section">
                    <h2>Finally</h2>
                    
                    <p>I'd like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude to hirothings, who provided the major catalyst for this development. Thank you so much.</p>

                    <p>A small feature has taken flight as a standalone app, triggered by one warm comment.<br>
                    If you'd like, please download it and share your "Fuchidori" creations on social media! Nothing would make me happier than if this app could add even a little color to your daily life.</p>
